title: I am Stefan Dimitrijevic
subtitle: Front-end Student
description: I am an active and ambitious person who likes to take on tasks with different degrees of responsibility and difficulty. I have a strong sense of service and enjoy meeting and working with new people. People who know me see me as an open and happy person who likes to get to know new people. I'm good at taking in new information and learning new things.
By having started a company together with another person and having worked a lot in a group through previous experiences, I have learned a lot about willingness to cooperate and co-operation. I think this is both instructive and interesting as more than 1 brain usually works best. Right now I am studying to be a Frontend developer at EC education in Helsingborg where I have a passion for programming
